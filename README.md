Project Exam 2 

Description:

I chose option 2 in this project exam which was to create a website that allowed visitors to Bergen city to find hotels, B&B's and guesthouses. This site will allow the users to send enquires to the different accomodations and to search through every accomodation. I created an API with Strapi and deployed it on Heroku.

Visitor side:
- Homepage
- Search bar with auto dropdown with hotel names that match what has been typed
- A results page
- A hotel specific page which displays all of the details for the chosen hotel.
- An enquiry page on a separate page
- A contact page which will send directly to the admin

Admin side: 
- Login section that uses JWT tokens
- A list of enquiries
- A list of contact messages
- Admin can create a new establishment
